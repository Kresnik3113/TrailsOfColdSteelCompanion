A lot of the charm from playing a Legend of Heroes game is that NPC dialogue will change depending on when you talk to them. If you are ever lost in the game, pressing the Square button will open the navigation menu, which will tell you the next objective. Now go to the north exit to Thors Military Academy, watch the orientation event.
    </string>
    <string name="prologue2">
"        When you have control over Rean again, go and examine your weapon on the left. You will receive a Master Quartz along with your weapon. Open the menu and equip the Master Quartz in the Orbment menu. Afterwards there will be some arguments between the rest of the class, when everyone is finished talking, only Eliot and Gaius will join your party.

Depending on your performance in battle, you can gain bonus exp on your victory. The more times you have fight the monster, more information regarding that monster will be added into your notebook. There is also an ability and an item (Battle Scope) that allows you to unlock all this information at once. If you are planning getting the platinum trophy, you will need to filled the Monster Guidebook completely.

Get the Needle Shot Quartz located in the treasure chest to your north. If you forgot the treasure chest, Eliot will remind that there is an object right there. As you head downstairs, you will encounter a Orbment Charging Station, these are used to fully restore your party. As you go a little further, you will encounter a slime-type enemy, these Grass Dromes are weak against Arts attack. You can cast Arts at it, or rely on Eliot to hurt it. As you go further you will find a insect-type monster. There will be a lot in this battle, the best method is to rely on Gaius's Craft ability, Gale Stinger as it has the ability to paralyze. Afterwards, Machias will join your party. From here, keep moving forward, you will eventually meet up with the girls. As you continue further, you will encounter Fie as well, from here you can find a treasure chest containing the Tear Orbment located on the west. Keep moving forward to the east area, you will encounter Jusis fighting some monsters. Afterwards Machias and Jusis will argue, you are given two choices, if you reprimand Jusis, Machias will stay with your party, if you stop Machias, Jusis will join your party. Then take the south exit, to go Underground area 3. From here there is a treasure chest located on the north and south corner. When you have pick up the two treasure chest, take the southeast exit to go the next area. Heal up by using Orbment Charging station, and save your game as well, as there is a boss fight right just ahead.

        The best thing you can do for this boss fight is to use Eliot's Craft ability, this will recover your HP each turn. The boss also carries a lot of area type attacks, it's best for you to have your party member spread out, so they don't all get hit by it's area attack. Arts are highly effective against it's first form due to it's poor magic defense. When you have drop the boss's HP below 50%, it will change form. The second form, is a bit more aggressive and has different stats then the previous form, with stronger magic defense but lower physical defense. Overall if you keep yourself buff up with Eliot's Craft ability, this battle should be a piece of cake."

Start by going all the way to the north area of the map, you will find a lever to will open the gate west of the starting entrance. Head over there to get to Underground Waterway 2, once you have reach to the center of the map, Jusis will join your party. Jusis can also now use his S-Break ability as well. You can go to the northeast area to pick up a treasure chest, there is an exit there that leads you outside which you will find Teara in a treasure chest. Return to Underground Waterway 2, and go the west area, you will find a very long ladder, climb all the way up to find a Monster Chest. There will be 8 Platinum Bugs inside, there is a trophy for killing 8 monsters at once, simply have all the monster position near each other and use Fie's S-Break to instantly wipe them.

        Boss P.Army Soldier

The Provincial Army Soldiers are just your average grunt type enemy. They do have a lot of HP however, with most of their attacks being single target, so you really don't need to worry about spreading your party members. The soldiers can do one powerful attack which could cause one of your allies to be fainted for a few turns. Just focus on defeating one at a time and then go for the other soldier. If you have your CP maxed, I suggest you save it for later.
When you have defeated the Soldiers, escape from the Underground Waterway, another boss battle will ensue.

Boss Kazakh Doven B and R

This will be the final boss fight of this chapter. Focus on defeating one of the dogs first, I would suggest you go for Doven R (The one that is covered in Gold Plates) first. As Doven R has the ability to buff themselves. The boss can deal massive damage on a single target, so its recommended you buff yourself up with abilities such as Crest to raise your defense. If you save your S-Break from earlier, it would come pretty handy for this. Since the boss can deal massive damage on a single target, I would suggest you to keep your allies HP at 1400-1800 at all times.
Watch the event scene. The Chapter will end and will add up all the AP you have accumulated in this Chapter."

Boss G and Jaeger Dropouts times 4

This battle is quite straightforward. There are four Jaegars who act just like regular enemy grunts. They attack from range and can hit multiple targets. Focus on defeating them first and then on Gideon. Gideon also has the ability to impede your arts, so if you want to cast magic, it needs to be cast before his turn or else he would try to cancel it with his Fast Draw ability. Milllium and Gaius' S-Break will wonders for this battle as it has a large area radius.

Boss Ginosha-Zanak and Zesvia

This boss is actually really strong. It has attacks that can poison your characters, along with an area attack that can hit all party members. This can cause seal, which makes it a complete pain. However this has a very simple attack pattern, it has some minion spiders with it, if you defeated a spider, it will try to call more spiders in battle. Which caps out at four, so if there is no spider for the boss to summon, then it will use its attack if not then it keeps calling for more. If you happen to equip Poison and Seal resistant accessories it will be really useful for this battle.

However the next boss fight is unwinnable, it automatically ends after 15 turns or so, just make sure you have someone that can analyze the boss (Eliot won't be with your party, so having a battle scope item or the Analyze quartz will help), if you intend on collecting the trophy for analyzing all enemies.

Go inside and you will fight a group of Shadow Spirits. After that, pick up the treasure chest to the south, it contains a Rakshasha quartz. Then now take the stairs and go all the way to the end. When you reach near the boss room, there is a Orbment Charging Station located there for you to heal up. It is highly recommended to equip Nightmare resistant accessories before you fight the upcoming battle. When you all prepared go inside and face the boss.

        Boss Nosferatu

        This boss is very similar to the end boss of Chapter 3, it will constantly summon Shadow Spirts to aid him in battle. If you defeat all of the spirits, it will focus on summoning more instead of attacking you. The boss has some really deadly moves, so it highly recommended to use large area type moves that can hit multiple targets. (Equipping Emma with Cross Crusade work wonders for this fight). The boss can also cause the Nightmare ailment to your party, so make sure you equip Nightmare resistant accessory on the most useful party member. The most annoying thing about this fight is when the Boss uses, Soul Pinon, it will put one of your party members out of commission and will slowly drain that person's health. Just keep focus on using your area type skills, and when the HP of the boss gets low, use your S-Break and finish it off.

By doing a Link Attack, you can use Link Burst by pressing the Square Button. This is similar to Link Rush, except it consume 5 Bravery points and have the entire party attacking. As for this area, if you are higher than level 49, then you are even stronger then you are at the prologue. Anyways, head straight north to the next area. You will fight a group of drones, since Instructor Sara is with you, she has really powerful Master Quartz that allows her to drain HP/EP per attack. Defeat the drones to continue on. You will notice the layout here is totally different then the prologue version, go east through the stairs and on the northeast room, you will find a treasure chest with Mind 3 inside. Now head out through the southeast exit to Storage Floor 1. Head downstairs and follow the path, there is two treasure chest along the way, eventually you will find the exit to the southwest area. This will lead you to the bottom area of Barracks. Now head to the room on the east to find a Flare Bomb in the treasure chest, and then go the west room. In here examine the notebook, you will learn the "Hashed Beef Rice" recipe. You can head out through the south exit if you want to see a short event, if you want to continue forward, head out through the northeast exit to the Relay area. Head down and you can find a treasure located on the room in the south end. When you near the exit, there is a Orbment Charging Station, Heal up and exit out to the Crossbell side of the fortress. You will fight two Zephyanthes, it the same end boss from the prologue. This mini boss can hit really hard with it's lasers and electric abilities, however you can customize your party a lot more making this fight even easier then the prologue. You can easily Seal the boss, so Gaius' Gale Stinger works pretty effective against this boss.

After you defeated the boss, run back to the Orbment Charging Station and heal up, and then go back outside. Head all the way north, it will take you to the north section of the Relay Area. Go directly to the room on the north, you will find three treasure chests. Then head down southwest, you will find another chest, along with the exit to Storage Floor 2. Head to the northeast exit to Storage Floor 1, there is a monster chest right here. You will get a Hellfire Quartz, return to Storage Floor 2, and follow the path west, you will find two treasure chest in the rooms located on the west side of the area. When you reach near the bottom, you can find a monster chest to the southeast end, this contains the Domination Quartz, one of the best quartz you can use. Now take the Southwest exit. Go west to pick a Shield 3 from the treasure, and then go to the east exit, and follow the path all the way to the end, you will find an Orbment Charging Station, heal up and prepare for the upcoming boss of the chapter. As you go outside you will face a group of terrorist first, then along with main boss.

        Boss S and R-Zephyanthes

        Focus on defeating the Zephyanthes first, these drones can deal heavy damage to your party. If they use their Electric attack, you can end up fainted for a few turns. Try to use crafts with large radius against them or Arts that can cover a large area. As for Scarlet, she isn't all that strong, however she can inflict the burn status on your characters. Scarlet is also easily succumb to abnormal status such as Seal and Burn. You can use Sara's flash ability to Seal her or Gaius' Gale Stinger. You can easily inflict the burn status on Scarlet if Emma has Aster Flare at this point.

        This is actually very easy compare to the previous Schoolhouse bosses.

Enter the boss room.

        Boss Vulcan and 3 terroists
        This is just like your regular boss fight, V isn't all that tough, he has a bunch of terrorist with him that are quite spread out preventing you from hitting them with your area skills. Just focus taking out the terrorist first and then focus on V. V can buff himself up to deal a ton of damage, when his HP drops below 50%, he will start using his S-Break which can do around 10000 to 11000 damage on a single target, which is an instant KO. Some status ailment that works pretty well against V such as blind. Just make sure you save most of your CP for the battle after this one.

        Boss C, G_Zephyyanthes and NT-I
        This is going to be the hardest battle in the game. But with the right preparations the battle can be easy. C usually will attack a single party member, or will summon mines (NT-1) and will detonate them when it gets to his turn. The explosion does about 1000 to 1500 damage per every mine exploded and causing faint as well. If you have faint resistant accessories it will come in real handy for this, as C is pretty fast and will probably have the chance to detonate those mines before you can destroy them. Then finally his two Machine sidekicks are the same as the mini boss from earlier, they can shoot lasers and cause faint with its electric discharge attack. If it cast arts, you can use Crescent Mirror to reflect it against C. Having Adamantine Shield is a must for this fight, C can use his S-Break when it's HP drop lower then 60%, Deadly Cross does enough damage to instantly KO any of your party members, so having this skill can nullify the damage. One of the most useful party member for this fight is Angelica, her craft, Zero Impact has a high chance of causing faint on C, with this you can keep C stuck on stunlock making this a lot less hassle to deal with.

        "Here the path will be split into three ways, just keep going north until the bridge fix itself, just a little bit pass there will be a switch, activate it with Emma or Eliot. This will remove the barrier at the west and east path at the starting point, in both path lies a treasure chest. When you pick up the two treasure chest, head back all the way north and enter the portal. This will take you to the boss room, heal up with the Orbment Charging Station and enter the next area to fight the boss. For the final boss fight, I would suggest equipping Sleep. Nightmare resistant accessories and the Shining or Adamantine Shield Quartz.

        Boss Loa Erebomius and Ashen Fragment

        This boss is very similar to the Nosferatu fight Lohengrin Castle. It has a bunch of minions that can shoot lasers and will cause your characters to sleep. When the main boss attacks, does massive amounts of damage, and can also cancel your arts. The boss has the ability take one of your party members away, and absorb life from the member is taken away, to release this party member from this state, you need to deal enough damage to the boss or have that person KO. Since the boss deal a ton of damage, you need watch for one of his AOE attacks, it can deal do about 6000 to 8000 damage on all your party members which can cause instant game over. A way of cheesing this boss is to use evasion tank strategy, which is to have a character with more then 50% evasion and cast Shining (insight on yourself), when this happens the boss almost always miss, including it's super attack. Because the boss has a ton of HP, a quick way of depleting it's HP is use something cause the Burn or the Freeze status, they have a chance of working, but if it lands, the boss will 5% of it's HP upon it's turn which can speed the process of this fight.
After the event scene, the game will add up all of the AP you have earned. There is a total of a 441 AP that is earn throughout the game, if you manage to get to 430, you will get the Valedictorian trophy.

After this event you can select someone very close to dance with you, doing so with get the hidden Bonding trophies with that character. To unlock the dance event with that character you must fulfill one of the conditions listed below.

        October 30
Watch the event scene, when you control Rean, go to the Academy Field and speak to Lambert, this will update his profile. You should prepare everything you want to transfer for the next playthrough, such as selling things you don't need or spending all your money on things you want to bring on the next playthrough. Now visit Towa at the Student Council Room (Student Union Building), George at the Engineering Building and Millium at the Old School House 7th floor. Afterwards Millium will come with you, now leave Trista for another event scene. Then visit the Class VII dorms. Then visit Crow's Room (Room 206, upstairs). Return to the school area, and watch the event scene.

When you can control Rean again, you should be at the school front gate, return the Main Building 2F and speak to Vivi or Linde on the west hallway. Doing so will update their profiles. Now go speak to George by the front gate, when you are all prepared, examine the gate and leave for the final battle.
        Boss Drakken
        This battle is very easy compare to the boss you just faced at the Old School house. Just treat the boss as a regular grunt with a ton of HP. This boss doesn't have any special attacks, it just uses basic attack that hits a radius of it's target. Just keep your character healed up and keep attacking it like a regular enemy and eventually it will go down. The boss is also immune to all status effects, so don't bother trying to inflict abnormal status.

        Boss Spiegel
        Make sure you scan the boss, and after two turns, the boss will use the Reactive Shield skill, making the boss completely invincible. The boss eventually will use an attack that will instantly wipe your party. After the event scene, you will be using the Ash Knight for mech combat, its like playing a game of rock-paper-scissors. You need to select a body part to hit and attacking the correct part will land a critical hit which allows you to do a Link attack, this is the only way to win this fight. The correct part to hit is based on the stance of the enemy,

        Boss Azure Knight

        This is similar to the previous battle, except the boss can do a link attack on you as well. To win this battle you must fully take advantage of link attacks, you will barely win this fight at the end due to how fragile your mech is. One of the biggest difference with this fight, is that you have a sword with you, with additional abilities, such as Morning Moon, a defensive stance that is used for countering. When the Azure Knight's HP drops below 25%, it will start using the defense stance. Which will evade your attacks, during this phase you can time it with the counter ability (Morning Moon) to deal the best damage to it without losing most of your health. Or do not attack it at all and wait till it changes stances.
